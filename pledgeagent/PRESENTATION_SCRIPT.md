- *"Skin in the game. Proof on the chain."*
- *"The agent that makes your word mean something."*

## The Problem (30–45 seconds)

**Opening:**

"Ninety-two percent of New Year's resolutions fail by February. Not because people don't want to change—but because nothing enforces them.

We tell ourselves we'll go to the gym. We'll ship the side project. We'll wake up at 5. Then life happens. There's no consequence. No referee. No skin in the game. So we slip, we forget, and we give up—again.

Reminders don't work. Motivation fades. Accountability without enforcement is just hope. And hope doesn't move the needle.

**The real problem:** we need something that doesn't remind us—something that *judges* us. Fairly, transparently, and with real stakes."

---

## The Solution (45–60 seconds)

**PledgeAgent:**

"PledgeAgent is an adversarial AI agent that enforces your commitments through financial stakes and proof verification.

Here's how it works:

1. **You define your mission.** Clear, measurable goals—gym 4x a week, ship a feature by Friday, no junk food for 30 days. You set the rules.

2. **You lock your stake.** Real money goes into a smart contract on Base. Not to us—to the contract. Your commitment is now backed by skin in the game.

3. **You submit proof.** Photos, screenshots, or data. Our AI agent—powered by vision models and fraud detection—verifies that your proof matches your goal. No loopholes. No 'I'll do it tomorrow.'

4. **You succeed or you forfeit.** Hit the goal, get your stake back. Miss it, and the contract distributes the funds according to the rules you agreed to. The agent doesn't negotiate. It enforces.

We don't own your money. We don't approve or reject you manually. The system is transparent: every verification is logged and traceable with Opik, so you—and anyone auditing the system—can see exactly how decisions are made."

## Why Everyone Needs This (45–60 seconds)

**Personal:**

"Everyone has a goal they keep postponing. The workout. The course. The side project. The habit. PledgeAgent turns 'I'll try' into 'I'm staked.' It's for anyone who's tired of breaking promises to themselves and wants a system that doesn't let them off the hook."

**Teams & creators:**

"Teams and creators can use it for deadlines and deliverables. Stake a goal, submit proof, get verified. No more vague 'I'm working on it.' Proof and stakes make commitments real."

**Health, learning, and habits:**

"Doctors and coaches want patients and clients to follow through. PledgeAgent gives them a verifiable, stake-backed layer: did the patient actually do the rehab? Did the student actually do the practice? The agent verifies; the contract enforces."

**Trust and transparency:**

"Because we use Opik, every AI decision is observable. Judges, auditors, and users can see why a proof was approved or rejected. That's accountability for the agent, not just the user. We're building the kind of AI system that can be trusted because it can be inspected."

**Closing:**

"So it's not just an app. It's a new default: when you make a promise, you can back it with stakes and proof, and an AI agent can enforce it fairly. That's why it matters—not for a few power users, but for everyone who's ever said 'this time will be different' and wants it to actually be different."

## Short Pitch (60 seconds total)

**Problem (15 sec):**  
"Most resolutions and commitments fail because there's no enforcement. Reminders and motivation aren't enough."

**Solution (25 sec):**  
"PledgeAgent is an AI agent that enforces your goals. You set a goal, lock a stake in a smart contract on Base, and submit proof—photos or data. Our AI verifies it with vision models and fraud detection. Succeed, you get your stake back. Fail, the contract executes. Every decision is logged with Opik for full transparency."

**Why it matters (20 sec):**  
"It's for anyone who's tired of breaking promises to themselves—and for teams, coaches, and creators who need verifiable accountability. We're making 'skin in the game' and 'proof of work' the standard for personal and professional commitments."

**Tagline:**  
"Accountability enforced by AI."

## Demo Flow (if presenting live)

1. **Home:** "This is PledgeAgent. One line: accountability enforced by AI."
2. **Create Goal:** "I set a goal—e.g. 'Gym 4x this week'—choose stake and duration, and lock it. The contract holds the funds."
3. **Submit Proof:** "I upload a photo of the gym. The AI checks it against my goal and metadata, runs fraud checks, and returns approve or reject. All of that is traced in Opik."
4. **Dashboard:** "Here are my stats, my streak, and the system status. DB, blockchain, Gemini, and Opik—all visible so you know the system is running and observable."

## One-Slide Summary (for decks)

- **Problem:** Commitments fail without enforcement; no referee, no stakes.
- **Solution:** AI agent + smart contract: stake on Base, submit proof, get verified; succeed or forfeit.
- **Differentiator:** Vision + fraud detection + behavioral logic; full observability with Opik; non-custodial contracts.
- **Tagline:** Accountability enforced by AI.
- **Why now:** AI can verify proof at scale; L2s make stakes cheap and fast; tools like Opik make AI decisions auditable.
